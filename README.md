The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a severe and rapid decline in economic activity, resulting in substantial job losses in the early months of 2020. Government-imposed restrictions and public apprehension about the virus led to individuals staying at home and businesses closing. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the authoritative source for determining business cycle phases, the economic downturn associated with the pandemic lasted just two months: March and April 2020.

I've created a collection of Tableau dashboards, containing key statistics sourced from New York's Citi Bike Program, intertwining these insights to craft a captivating storyline. These dashboards are thoughtfully situated within the context of the events described above, providing a dynamic platform for showing the intricacies of the economic landscape during this challenging period. Moreover, these visualizations can serve as a valuable reference point for comparative analysis with data from different timeframes.
